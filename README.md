# HTML & CSS - Animating & Transforming

This is a school project to exercice CSS animation and transformation. I also did one animation with JavaScript. I created a responsive countdown to Christmas page. The heading scales up to it's deafault size when page loads. The reindeer jiggles back and forth and it's nose will turn red on hover. There is a real time countdown on the page. The snowflake icon will scale a bit up on hover and if you click it, snow starts falling. Enjoy! :)

You will find comments in the code on all relevant blocks.
